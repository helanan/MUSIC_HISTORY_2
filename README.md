## Usage

This project allows you to organize and display your favorite songs using JavaScript arrays, loops, and HTML content rendering.

### Requirements

To set up your Music History project:

- Use JavaScript arrays, loops, and innerHTML to showcase your favorite songs.
- Download the `songs.js` file, which contains an array of strings with song information.
- Add one song to the beginning and one to the end of the array.
- Iterate over the array and remove any irrelevant words or characters.
- Replace the `>` character in each item with a `-` character.
- Add each formatted string to the DOM in the `index.html` file's main content area.

Each song should follow this format: `{Song name} by {Artist} on the album {Album}`.
