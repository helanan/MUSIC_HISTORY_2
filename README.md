Requirements

Use JavaScript arrays, loops, and innerHTML to show the music you love.

Students must use JavaScript to create a list of songs in the index.html file for their Music History project. Have them download the songs.js file, which contains an array of strings with song information.

- [ ] Each student must add one song to the beginning and the end of the array.

- [ ] Loop over the array and remove any words or characters that obviously don't belong.

- [ ] Students must find and replace the > character in each item with a - character.

- [ ] Must add each string to the DOM in index.html in the main content area.

{Song name} by {Artist} on the album {Album}

Merging your branch

After you've got all of the requirements completed, follow these steps.

- [ ] In your musichistory directory, enter the command git checkout master. This switches you back to the master branch.

- [ ] git merge -X theirs version2

- [ ] If you see a vim screen with a default message in it just :x to save and exit.

Your branch is now merged into the master branch and you can push the master branch up to Github with git push origin master.
